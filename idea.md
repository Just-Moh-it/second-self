# Panda Assist: AI Phone Call Automation Platform

## Project Vision

Build an AI-powered customer support agent that can autonomously handle phone calls for users, with the ability to call multiple businesses in parallel, navigate phone menus, gather information, and provide real-time interaction monitoring with human takeover capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

### Hybrid AI Model (Inspired by Chat Supervisor Pattern)

- **Realtime Agent**: Handles voice conversation flow, basic interactions, and maintains natural dialogue
- **Supervisor Agent**: Text-based model that handles complex logic, function calling, decision making, and information processing
- **Coordination**: Realtime agent defers to supervisor for all non-trivial tasks via function calls

### Core Technical Stack

- **Current Base**: Twilio + OpenAI Realtime API + WebSocket Server
- **Enhancement Target**: Multi-agent architecture with parallel call handling
- **Frontend**: Real-time monitoring interface with takeover capabilities
- **Backend**: Distributed call management and menu navigation system

## Development Approach

### Step-by-Step Development Strategy

This project will be developed **incrementally and fluidly** - no rigid phases, just continuous improvement and testing. Each step should be small, testable, and build upon the previous work.

### Core Development Principles

1. **Incremental Changes**: Make one small change at a time
2. **Test Everything**: Verify each change works before moving on
3. **Fluid Progression**: Move between different areas as needed, don't get stuck
4. **Real-World Validation**: Test with actual scenarios early and often
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Expect multiple attempts to get things right

### Current Starting Point

- ✅ **Existing System**: Working Twilio + OpenAI Realtime API integration
- ✅ **Single Call Capability**: Can handle one phone call with basic AI conversation
- ✅ **WebSocket Architecture**: Server manages connections between Twilio, OpenAI, and frontend
- ✅ **Function Calling**: Basic weather function example implemented

### Next Logical Steps (Flexible Order)

**Core Architecture Enhancement**:

- Implement Supervisor Agent pattern for complex decision making
- Add `getSupervisorResponse` function to current system
- Test hybrid agent coordination with existing single call setup

**Multi-Call Foundation**:

- Design session management for multiple simultaneous calls
- Implement outbound calling capability via Twilio
- Create basic multi-call monitoring interface

**Menu Navigation Capability**:

- Add DTMF (digit sending) functionality to Twilio integration
- Implement basic menu detection and response logic
- Test with real business phone menus

**Advanced Features** (as needed):

- Route caching and learning system
- Human takeover functionality
- Complex function calling framework
- Real-world use case implementation
